Daily Emotet IOCs observed

To quote Oscar Wilde, "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness" I humbly admit I'm taking a page from @pr0xylife.  I enjoy the format @pr0xylife created and published each day... so here I am.  Flattering.


These are IOCs observed from samples I've seen during the day.
